Arraylist vs Linkedlist - Accessing by index fast in ArrayList, removing by index fast in LinkedList
Why map is not considered as a collection - because map has a key and a value. Map doesnot give you either only a set of keys or a set of values to implement collections. Map is a combination of three collections - keys, values, key-value pairs
HashMap vs TreeMap vs HashTable

Datasource -> Session(gets db username password from app properties to establish connection) -> hibernate transaction manager -> queries(traditional way of communicating with database)
Spring with hibernate used to have a plain pojo without any annotations. associations, mappings, validations, table details and all are declared in hibernate mapping configuration file which is .hbm.xml, later replaced with ORM annotations in entity class we are using currently

ORM
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_UNCOMMITTED)
@Modifying(clearAutomatically = true, flushAutomatically = true)
@Transactional(propogation = Propogation.REQUIRES_NEW)
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "accountDetails", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
@JoinColumn(name = "Account_Id", nullable = false)
JoinColumn(name = "Account_Association_Activity_Cd", referencedColumnName = "Account_Association_Activity_Entity_Id")
Joincolumn for table joins... annotation wilkl be given for the common attribute of both tables(foreign key)
name = column name of row in db in current table
reference column name = column name of db i child table
nullable = false is same as validation of nonnull annotation
persist: when we save person entity, address entity will also get saved
merge ; update person entity, address entity will also get updated
remove: remove person entity, address entity will also be removed
refresh: to refresh data in the object. perhaps there was a change on database which needs to be synced. (Sync from database)
detach: .....?
all: performs all
orphanRemoval: whether to apply remove operation to entities that have been removed from the relationship and to cascade the remove operation to those entities.
propogation.REQUIRES_NEW: new transaction will be started in a parallel thread with an existing transaction
propogation.REQUIRED: existing transaction will be reused for this method also. if no existing transaction then new transaction thread will be started
clear automatically and flush automatically - used to clear all the cache data after the transaction is completed before closing session.
An sql query will be committed and changes will be reflected only after whole transaction is successful. otherwise transaction will be rolled back and aborted
cascadetype all - sued to retrieve all the data from the child table instead of retriving only the primary key of it when we hit the parent entity
fetchtype lazy loading - when you create object of parent entity, child entity is not involved in it. you can access child entity of that object by using its particular getter.
eager loading - when you create object of parent entity . child entity will also be populated at the same time
amazon product categories is example for lazy loading
spring batch processing - ETL: Extract Transfer Load

design patterns
AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming)
Spring.config.import
@profile(name = "abc, "def") - used at class level to denote that the specific property files should be used in that class
bean dependency ambiguity resolution by @qualifier("abc") or @resource(name="abc")
synchronized blocks - (synchronized is a keyword declared before methods to make it thread safety) if a method is been accessed by multiple users at a time data will get currepted. to avoid that we use this.
static block vs constructor vs non static block. which executes first when we run application
Collections.isEmpty(obj)
Objects.nonNull(obj)
duplicating table - create table new_table as (select * from old_table) or we can use one query to copy rows(create table new_table like old_table) and another query to copy data(insert into new_table (select * from old_table)
while vs foreach vs dowhile vs for
thread safety
multi threading vs seaquential programming
balanced tree
concurrent hashmap vs treemap vs linked hashmap vs hashmap
concurrency vs multi threading vs sequential programming
thread pooling
dev properties vs vm arguments
ivy project vs springboot project
fail fast vs fail safe
CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteHashmap vs normal arraylist and hashmap
liskov substitution principle
how to implement an interface partially( can implement all methods of interface by implementing it to an abstract class and extend abstract class to use methods we need in child classes) but extending is bad practice in java and should be avoided. so declare seperate interfaces according to the need
SOLID principles in java:
S - Single Responsibility
O - Open for extension, closed for modification
L - Liskov substitution - don't put all methods in single interface, go for segregation
I - Interface segregation
D - Dependency Injection
Interface segregatio example:
	carControls
	  -start()
	  -stop()
	  -breakSystem()

	carEngineRelated
	  -engine()
	  -accelerate()

	HeroHonda implements CarControls
	  start, stop, breaksystem
	BMW implements carEngineRelated
	  engine, accelerate
	Bajaj implements CarControls, CarEngineRelated
	start, stop, breaksystem, engine, accelerate
set vs list - insertion order is not preserved because no index or pointers.... insertion order is preserved, unique....allows duplicates
completable vs multithreading
how many ways to use multithreading
IOC container and its types - applicationcontext, beanfactory
role based security vs url based security
comparable and comparator in streams

map: entrySet()[returns collection view of a map], keySet(), values()
Map.Entry class -- Map.Entry.getKey(), Map.Entry.getValue()

Every application has primary logic(business logic), secondary logic(error handling, logs, health and metrics,...)
AOP and observability are Secondary logic category
AOP:
for auditing, logging, performance
@Aspect- at class level to write all AOP logic
Advices- Around, before, after returning
pointcut- which method or class or package this AOP is 
joinpoint.proceed() executes the methods

springboot observability:
replacement for spring AOP and available from springboot 3.0
Can be clubbed with actuator metrics
Can see how many times the method was hit, time taken, max time, errors occured, logs and many more

Application properties:
application-dev, application-kafka, application-test is the syntax if we want to use it directly with @Profile("dev")
if we give @Profile at class level that means when a particular property file is in action this class will be loaded
@configurationproperties(prefix="a") if our application properties has configurations with two prefixes a and b and we just want configuration with a

any property declared externally or not in the above syntax:
@PropertySource(fully qualified path of the property file) instead of @Profile

RabbitMQ
Queue messenging system
Publishers -> Exchange -> Binders -> Queue -> Consumers
Publisher will send message and BinderKey to Exchange and according to the binderKey it will go to that particular queue
where as in kafka Zookeeper will decide which partition in which topic that message should go
Exchange will send the message to that particular Binder which sends to its corresponding Queue
In RabbitMq configuration we will define routing with ExchangeKey, BinderKey and QueueName which will be having a RoutingKey which we will define in application properties
for posting message to one queue we will have one routing bean which should have one routing Key which will be used by Publisher/Producer to send message
producer/Publisher will send message using that routingKey which we can get from application properties
listener/Consumer will get the message from Queue by subscribing it with QueueName
The message will be stored in Queue unless it will be consumed by all subscribers. so RabbitMQ will not have retry mechanism
where as kafka topic can have message only for a particular time . so it will be having retry mechanism

Docker image will be stored in multiple pods in containers in kubernetes so that the api gateway will retry the request for the pod which is free ?
offsetcontroller
atomic reference
immutable vs mutable with examples

for vs foreach:
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
foreach(type variable : object to iterate)
foreach will be used for collections whereas for can be used for any datatype
foreach is enhanced for loop and introduced in jdk5
when the condition is unknown we go with foreach

OAUTH architecture:
Springboot-Starter-OAuth-Client is the dependency
User -> OAuth client -> Authentication server(Authentication+Authorization) -> Resource server -> Authentication server again for verification
User should pass: Username, Password, ClientId, SecretId, GrantType
OAuth client will redirect these info to authentication server when you hit the token endpoint
Authentication server verifies clientId and secretId which are constants. then verifies Username, password from DB. checks the authorization for the requested resource and generates token
then the token reaches resource server which haves the role and request url.
resource server reverify token with authentication server and gives access to the requested resource/api
key cloak is a software which is available recently and we can use it to replace authentication server and oauth client and even database if we are interested to use
SSO- single sign on
Google Cloud PLatform ->more products-> APIs and services-> credentials-> go to console and create a new client, copy clientId and secretId to configure it in our web application OAuth and use google for authentication

Queryparam vs pathvariable
variable declaration, positional parameters
mostly used for db hits in dao layer, used for business logic purpose in service layer
can give in any order, order should be preserved

Restful vs soap
http, ...
stateless, has state
don't need to wait for response after state established, will wait for response after state established
Json, XML
